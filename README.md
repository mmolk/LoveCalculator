# LoveCalculator

A simple "Love calculator" made in Java

Another one of my early projects. A single .java file program without objects and multiple classes. This is a simple calculator that reminds us on the payable SMS love-match calculators from the 90s and early 2000s when the first coloured mobile phones became popular.

The algorythm is made-up but - to me - it seemed the most logical for this purpose. The program runs in the console and has a very simple graphic output similar to my Rock-Paper-Scissors program, using the Thread.sleep method for the delayed print-out.

It takes two names as two separate inputs; the names are then converted to integers: each letter has an ASCII value. The values are then summed up; the smaller value is divided by the bigger one and multiplied by 100 so we get a percentage of the match. 

For the sake of "credibility" of the program, I've made up a fictional constant that makes the result more credible.

The details are explained in the code itself in the comments.
